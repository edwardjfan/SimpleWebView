# SimpleWebView

Hi BCS Members and other randos that find this link!

This is a native iOS webview app (`UIWebView`).  There are two versions, one written in Objective-C and one in Swift.

Currently the webview loads www.google.com by default.

You change the default URL by updating the `kDefaultURL` text in `ViewController.swift` (Swift) or `ViewController.m` (Objective-C).
